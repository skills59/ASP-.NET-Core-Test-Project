# ASP-.NET-Core-Test-Project
interesting! this is my first ASP.NET Core project. its not so bad after all. i was just trying 
it out to see if it could be cool to use and it isnt so bad after all. i might start building all of my projects with dotnet if things go the right way.

### Lunch application from your terminal with the command 
-- Dot net Run 



Enjoy..
